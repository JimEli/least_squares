# least_squares
### Overly simplistic linear least squares, quadratic and polynomial regression.
Includes code to send data to gnuplot to view result in graphic form. This functionality requires Boost, gnuplot-iostream and C++17 (see notes inside main.cpp file). Gnuplot inclusion can be bypassed by removing define for "INCLUDE_GNUPLOT".
